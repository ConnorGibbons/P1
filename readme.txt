question 1:
It seems like a decent amount of the top words are everyday words that should probably be stop words. 
The top 8 words are mostly pronouns, which aren't important features of this story. You could discern however that most of the top pronouns are feminine (she/her),
so the people most often mentioned in the story are female. 
Some relevant words did make it to the top, though. Elinor and Marianne are in index 10 and 18 respectively, which makes sense 
, as they are the main character's daughters. 

Question 2: 
I would argue that most pronouns should be stop words. From looking at the top words of this text, most of them
are pronouns but don't really tell us anything about this story, besides that there are important female characters -- which could also be gleaned from 
"Elinor" and "Marianne" being top words. These are words that appear frequently in just about any document, not this one in particular. 

Question 3:
See "p1graph"

Question 4: 
See the picture, "p1graph2". Using K = 100, and beta = .535, the line roughly fits what is seen in Sense and Sensibility. So it does follow Heaps' Law.
